            What I don't have patience for
        </h2>
        <p>
            I dislike laziness in the work and distractions during work whether individually or as a team.<br>

            How best to communicate with me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I love to communicate with everyone and open to any suggestion as we try to solve problems.<br>
            I love when reproaches are made in a gentle and constructive way.  
        </p>

        <h2>
            How to help me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am usually an introvert person in the outside but have so much confidence in my abilities and skills and engaged in whatever I start.<br>
            I am creative and I love challenges and solving problems.<br>
            Meanwhile, I am kind of reserved when I donâ€™t know people around me but immediately after one team project, I can give the best of my abilities.<br>
            I am actively working on it and strongly believe that this can come earlier as I am introduced in a warmed and welcoming group.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What people misunderstand about me
        </h2>
        <p>
            People usually believe that I am shy and not talkative which is not true.<br>
            Like I said earlier, I am very talkative, confident and engaged in what I start.<br>
            I am a friendly person and enjoy working as a team to solve problems.<br>
            My experiences have shown that I have always been an essential element in teams increasing team productivity by 15%
